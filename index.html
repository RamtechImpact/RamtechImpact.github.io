            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Here at RamTech 59, we cultivate culture, community, and STEAM. Together we work to expand the future workforce and push students to aim for higher education. Along with a strong robotics base, we maximize all possible outreach opportunities through showcases such STEM Day at the Capitol, Marlin's STEM Day, and the Miami-Dade College Maker Fair. RamTech 59 is a staple in our county and South Florida as a whole, becoming a backbone of our district, and helping all teams with problems related to the robot, organization, and outreach.

                Facilitated in a public school, RamTech 59 understands what struggles our members can face in regards to learning. We do our best to find a solution that works for everyone whether it involves motivation or advanced classes. RamTech 59 pushes the learning of students with other programs depending on their passions. For example, the Drones Program involves kids with more interest in aerospace over robotics.

            <h2>Inclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Doing our best push through the expectation of society, we are working to create an equitable environment. Coming from a low socioeconomic school with high ESOL student body, we operate with the utmost care for our students despite their background and highly encourage all students to join RamTech 59. Recently we have successfully merged with the HOSA organization branch of our school, which is highly female dominated, uniting the talents of our engineering and medical programs under RamTech.

                We have created a sense of community through the different cultures spread by our members. This is due to a program RamTech provides that allows each member to bring meals for the team during build season. With our students bringing dishes from their ethic backgrounds to share, they give the whole team a unique taste from around the world.
